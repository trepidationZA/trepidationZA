- 👋 Hi, I’m @trepidationZA
- 👀 I’m interested in the development of public spaces, technology, and the development of South Africa.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with data and code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps us get a sense of where the country is and how we can live better.
